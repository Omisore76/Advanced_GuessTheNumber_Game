# Advanced_GuessTheNumber_Game

## Introduction

This guessing game is more advanced than your average game. In this case, the computer has a secret number and the user is trying to guess the number. The user only has a limited number of guesses, so they have to be careful! If they guess wrong, they'll lose the game. To make things more challenging, the computer will give the user hints after each guess. The user has to use these hints to try to narrow down the possible numbers. This guessing game is sure to be a challenge for even the most seasoned gamers!
